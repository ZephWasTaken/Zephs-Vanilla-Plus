# Zeph's Vanilla+
Welcome to the Github page for my modpack! Here you can find the auto-updating versions of my mod pack!
## Installation Instructions
My preferred launcher is [Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/download/), so I'll be walking through the install process assuming you've already installed Prism and verified your Java path in Prism Settings>Java.
> 1. Press the green code<> button and download the ZIP
> 2. Inside the Prism launcher, add an instance and import the ZIP file
> - **NOTE: IT'S THE ZIP FILE THAT HAS (auto-updating) NAME**
> 3. Verify the installation. If all succeeds and the game launches, then the pack has succeessfully checked for updates on startup.
