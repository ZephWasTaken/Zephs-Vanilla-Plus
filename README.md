# Zeph's Vanilla+
Welcome to the Github page for my modpack! Here you can find the main .mrpack for Zeph's Vanilla+, as well as the auto-updating versions! In the top left of the page, you'll see a dropdown menu to switch branches. In order to stay up to date with the latest versions of the pack, switch from main to auto-updating before downloading. The auto updating .zip file will ensure ease of use in the future whereas the .mrpack file is the latest **stable** release of the pack.
## Installation Instructions
My preferred launcher is [Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/download/), so I'll be walking through the install process assuming you've already installed Prism and verified your Java path in Prism Settings > Java.
> 1. Press the green code<> button and download the repository. Be sure to select the correct branch!
> 2. Inside the Prism launcher, add an instance and import the .zip or .mrpack file
> - **NOTE FOR AUTO-UPDATERS: IT'S THE ZIP FILE THAT HAS (auto-updating) IN THE NAME! EXTRACT THE ZIP FIRST!!!!**
> 3. Verify the installation. If all succeeds and the game launches, then the pack has succeessfully installed.
